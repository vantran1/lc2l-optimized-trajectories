Code and Data Repository for Van Tran's Senior Thesis "Fuel Burn Tradeoffs in Safety-Optimized Trajectories for Uncrewed Aircraft Systems."

Unfortunately, because of data storage limitations due to large file sizes, I am unable to upload all data files into the repository. You are welcome to collect your own data but if you would like to have access the large data files, please email me at vantran@college.harvard.edu.
